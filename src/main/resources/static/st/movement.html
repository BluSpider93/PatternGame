    <body>
    After you move the character, this page should refresh. You'll then have to go to the mape page in order
    to see where the character is now. This is horribly inneficient; but its done in pure html. With a little
    JavaScript, this could be done in a very smooth action.

    I shoudl probably metnion that your character is represented by a 'U'.
